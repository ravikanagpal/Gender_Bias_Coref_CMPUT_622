## Execution Instructions
### Run

Use the google colab notebooks provided in src folder to run the two models:

1. E2E model - provided by Allen NLP and based on the work of [Lee, Kenton & He, Luheng & Lewis, Mike & Zettlemoyer, Luke. (2017). End-to-end Neural Coreference Resolution. 188-197. 10.18653/v1/D17-1018] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07045.pdf). 

2. Neural Coref model - provided by Huggingface and based on the work of  [Kevin Clark and Christopher D. Manning. 2016. Deep reinforcement learning for mention-ranking coreference models. In Empirical Methods on Natural Language Processing.](https://aclanthology.org/D16-1245.pdf)

### Data

The data used can be found in [data/](data/) folder

### Output

The output is stored in csv files corresponding to each model and can be found in the output directory.
